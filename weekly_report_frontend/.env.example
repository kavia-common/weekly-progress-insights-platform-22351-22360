# Copy to .env.server (ignored by git) and set values before running npm scripts.

# IMPORTANT:
# - Never prefix these with REACT_APP_ (those would be exposed to the browser).
# - These values are loaded only by Node scripts via dotenv.

# Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co

# Supabase SERVICE ROLE KEY (server-only)
